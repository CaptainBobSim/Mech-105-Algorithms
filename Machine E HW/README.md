## Machine E Homework
% Develop a MATLAB function that determines the LU Factorization of a
% square matrix. Your algorithm must use partial pivoting.

% For full credit, you must include appropriate error checking. If you are
% confused about what would be appropriate or have questions, feel free to
% come to office hours!

% Inputs:
% A - coefficient matrix
% Outputs:
% L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
% U - upper triangular matrix
% P - the pivot matrix
