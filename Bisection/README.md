Okay, so let me tell you about a game we can play called the bisection algorithm!

First, let's imagine we have a big jar filled with yummy candies. We want to find out how many candies are in the jar, but we don't want to count them one by one because that would take too long. So, we're going to play a guessing game to figure it out!

To start, I'll give you a piece of paper and a pencil. On the paper, you'll write down a number between 1 and 100, and that will be your guess for how many candies are in the jar.

Now, I'm going to tell you if your guess is too high or too low. If your guess is too high, we'll take all the candies out of the jar that are more than half your guess. If your guess is too low, we'll take out all the candies that are less than half your guess. Then, we'll count how many candies we have left and that will be our new jar size.

We'll keep playing this game, taking out candies based on your guess, until we find the exact number of candies in the jar. And that's the bisection algorithm!
