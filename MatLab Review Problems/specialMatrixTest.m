% Here is a test call of your fuction. Feel free to play around with testing in here and change anything you like
% The grading tests are not impacted by code in this section, and may test different cases than are given in the example here.
%   If you want to use this in matlab directly (i.e. not online), you must save your function as a file specialMatrix.m
%   and then can save this script as anything you like, say specialMatrixTest.m for example.
n = 4; m = 5;
specialMatrix(n,m)
