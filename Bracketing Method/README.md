% Create a MATLAB script that solves for  in degrees when F = 150N. Your
% script should create a plot of a function that is dependent on . Use the
% bisect function in your script file. It is included in Matlab Grader and
% can be called using [root, fx, ea, iter] = bisect(func, xl, xu, es,
% maxit); 
% Where the function inputs and outputs are the same as in the
% false position algorithm.
